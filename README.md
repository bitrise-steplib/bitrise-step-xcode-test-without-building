<details>
<summary>Inputs</summary>

| Key | Description | Flags | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `xctestrun` | Test run parameters file, generated during the build-for-testing action. | required | `$BITRISE_XCTESTRUN_FILE_PATH` |
| `destination` | Destination specifier describes the device to use as a destination.  The input value sets xcodebuild's `-destination` option. | required | `platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 11,OS=latest` |
| `test_repetition_mode` | Determines how the tests will repeat.  Available options: - `none`: Tests will never repeat. - `until_failure`: Tests will repeat until failure or up to maximum repetitions. - `retry_on_failure`: Only failed tests will repeat up to maximum repetitions. - `up_until_maximum_repetitions`: Tests will repeat up until maximum repetitions.  The input value together with Maximum Test Repetitions (`maximum_test_repetitions`) input sets xcodebuild's `-run-tests-until-failure` / `-retry-tests-on-failure` or `-test-iterations` option. |  | `none` |
| `maximum_test_repetitions` | The maximum number of times a test repeats based on the Test Repetition Mode (`test_repetition_mode`).  Should be more than 1 if the Test Repetition Mode is other than `none`.  The input value sets xcodebuild's `-test-iterations` option. | required | `3` |
| `relaunch_tests_for_each_repetition` | If this input is set, tests will launch in a new process for each repetition.  By default, tests launch in the same process for each repetition.  The input value sets xcodebuild's `-test-repetition-relaunch-enabled` option. |  | `no` |
| `xcodebuild_options` | Additional options to be added to the executed xcodebuild command. |  |  |
